ðŸ‘‹ Hello fellow MSTS members!

We would like to welcome you the the official MSTS github page, where all relevant coding content relating to MSTS presentations and workshops will be
provided to our members! 

We are looking to build out the MSTS github over the 2021-2022 academic year and we need your help! We would also like to leverage the power of open source
and make this an interactive space where students and executive members alike can share code, ideas and suggest code to build up relevant repositories
related to trading. Feel free to make any relevant pull requests which will be reviewed by the MSTS executive team and potentially integrated.

If any questions arise related to the content of the files in this github or more, feel free to contact the MSTS at tradingsociety@ssmu.ca, or you can 
directly contact our VP head of Trading at stanislas.motte@mail.mcgill.ca

Happy algorithmic trading!
