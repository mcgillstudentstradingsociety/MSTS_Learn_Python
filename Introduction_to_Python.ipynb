    "# What is Python?\n",
    "The first release of Python was in 1991. Since then, Python has arguably become the most well-known programming language in existence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, multipurpose programming language that is used in a wide range of domains and technical fields. The exxecutive sumary of python is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dy‐ namic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python’s simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is used by beginners, intermediate and professional coders to develop applications for a variety of purposes. In the Context of Finance, Python is extremely well-known and used in industry. The growing need for fast and exhasutive quantitative analysis make Python and programming essential tools to have when going into Finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Open Source \n",
    "The Open source features of python and programming in general make the language extremely effective through the benefits of network effects. As we will see, a major feature of Python as an ecosystem, compared to just being a programming language, is the availability of a large number of libraries and tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### A word of advice if you are new\n",
    "If you are new to coding, embrace the fact that coding takes time to understand, can be frustrating, but is worth it in the end.\n",

    "In Python, everything is an \"object\". These objects can take the form of data types, or data structures.\n",
    "There a a few important data types that are important to learn and understand. These allow us to define things such as integeres, decimals or words in python. Along with this, and also important, are data structures. These allow us to fit data types into specific sets, tie data types together and play order them in diffrent ways to effectively work with them.\n"
